# Minecraft-Material-Sorter
This project serves to aid Minecraft users whose storage system is too large to quickly gather materials for projects. It's written in React and NodeJS, with the project being built with vite.

# Usage
To use the tool begin by uploading a text file containing your minecraft storage system ordered line by line. So if your system starts with Oak logs, Oak planks, etc then line 1 of the txt file would be oak_log, line 2 would be oak_planks, and so on.
